# Requirements Specification for CLI Todo Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Todo application. The application will allow users to manage tasks directly from their terminal, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

## 2. Functional Requirements

The application shall provide the following core functionalities:

### FR1: Add Task
- **FR1.1:** The user shall be able to add a new task.
- **FR1.2:** Each task shall have a title.
- **FR1.3:** Each task may optionally have a description.
- **FR1.4:** The system shall automatically assign a unique identifier (ID) to each new task.
- **FR1.5:** The system shall automatically set the initial status of a new task as "incomplete".

### FR2: View Tasks
- **FR2.1:** The user shall be able to view a list of all existing tasks.
- **FR2.2:** For each task, the following information shall be displayed:
    - Task ID
    - Title
    - Description (if available)
    - Status (complete/incomplete)

### FR3: Update Task
- **FR3.1:** The user shall be able to update an existing task by its ID.
- **FR3.2:** The user shall be able to modify the title of a task.
- **FR3.3:** The user shall be able to modify the description of a task.
- **FR3.4:** It shall be possible to update either the title, the description, or both in a single operation.

### FR4: Delete Task
- **FR4.1:** The user shall be able to delete an existing task by its ID.
- **FR4.2:** Upon successful deletion, the task shall no longer appear in the list of tasks.

### FR5: Mark Task Status
- **FR5.1:** The user shall be able to mark a task as "complete" by its ID.
- **FR5.2:** The user shall be able to mark a task as "incomplete" by its ID.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1:** The application shall operate entirely within system memory. No tasks or application state shall be persisted to disk or external databases. Data will be ephemeral.

### NFR2: Usability
- **NFR2.1:** The application shall provide clear and concise success messages upon successful operation (e.g., task added, task updated, task deleted).
- **NFR2.2:** The application shall provide clear and concise error messages when an operation fails (e.g., invalid task ID, missing arguments).

### NFR3: Technical
- **NFR3.1:** The application shall be developed using Python 3.13 or a newer version.
- **NFR3.2:** The application shall be a pure Command-Line Interface (CLI) application, without any graphical user interface (GUI) components.

## 4. Project Structure Requirements

The project shall adhere to the following directory structure and file conventions:

### PSR1: Source Code
- **PSR1.1:** All Python source code (`.py` files) shall reside in a `src/` directory at the project root.

### PSR2: Specifications History
- **PSR2.1:** All specification documents, including this one, shall be stored in `specs/history/` relative to the project root.

### PSR3: Documentation
- **PSR3.1:** A `README.md` file shall be present at the project root, providing instructions for setup, installation, and usage of the application.
- **PSR3.2:** A `CLAUDE.md` file shall be present at the project root, outlining the rules and guidelines for AI-assisted code generation and interaction within the project, even if Claude is not used.

## 5. Constraints

- **CON1:** All development must follow the principles of Spec-driven development as outlined in the project's Constitution.
- **CON2:** No human-written code is allowed; all code must be generated by AI agents.
