# AI Development Rules (CLAUDE.md)

This file outlines the rules and principles governing the AI-driven development of this project.

## Core Principle: No Human-Written Code

All functional code, including Python scripts, tests, and configuration, must be generated by an AI agent. Humans are permitted to:
1.  Define high-level requirements and specifications.
2.  Create and approve implementation plans and task breakdowns.
3.  Execute the AI-generated code.
4.  Review and validate the final output.
5.  Orchestrate the AI agent's workflow.

Humans are strictly forbidden from writing or modifying the application's source code directly.

## Development Process

Development must adhere to the Spec-Driven-Development process defined in the project's `constitution.md`. Every implementation step must correspond to a task defined in `specs/history/tasks.md`.

## Agentic Responsibility

The AI agent is responsible for:
- Adhering to the project's constitution, requirements, and plan.
- Implementing the features as described in the tasks.
- Following a clean, layered architecture.
- Generating readable, maintainable, and correct code.
- Ensuring all code conforms to the PEP 8 style guide.
- Using only the approved technology stack (Python 3.13+, no external libraries unless specified).
